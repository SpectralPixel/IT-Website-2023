    <h1>Golden Age Minecraft</h1>
    <p>There are many Minecraft versions pre-dating it's official release in 2011. This website will be discussing these nostalgic versions.</p>

    <h2>Developement Phases</h2>
    <p>In Minecraft's Java Edition there were 7 main developement phases:</p>

    <h3><a href="versions/preclassic/preclassic.html">Pre-Classic</a></h3>
    <p>
        These were the first version of Minecraft. The only features were movement and block placing/breaking and <i>human mobs</i>.
    </p>
    

    <h3><a href="versions/classic/classic.html">Classic</a></h3>
    <p>
        The second developement phase introduced <i>survival mode</i>. Creative mode was removed in this phase and didn't get re-added until beta 1.8. This phase added new blocks and world generation features such as <i>trees, water and beaches</i>.
    </p>
    

    <h3><a href="versions/indev/indev.html">Indev</a></h3>
    <p>
        Indev, which stands for <u>in</u> <u>dev</u>elopement, implemented crucial features to survival mode such as <i>crafting</i> and <i>tools</i>. It also featured some wacky characters!
    </p>

    <h3><a href="versions/infdev/infdev.html">Infdev</a></h3>
    <p>
        Infdev, short for <u>inf</u>inite <u>dev</u>elopement implemented infinite terrain generation into Minecraft. It features strange terrain glitches and structures, such as <i>brick pyramids, monoliths, and the far lands!</i>
    </p>

    <h3><a href="versions/alpha/alpha.html">Alpha</a></h3>
    <p>
        <i>More mobs, more dimensions, more biomes!</i> Alpha unfortunately got rid of the nostalgic bright green grass, but it did bring with it a ton of new content.<br>
        <i>Multiplayer mode!</i> Though it was quite broken at the beginning, you can now play Minecraft with your friends!
    </p>

    <h3><a href="versions/beta/beta.html">Beta</a></h3>
    <p>
        In the final developement phase of Minecraft, more features were introduced such as <i>beds, dyes, complex redstone, and new rail types</i>. There were also many quality of life updates such as <i>inventory shortcuts, smooth lighting, and achievements</i>.

        Beta 1.8 and onwards were mostly preparing the game for full release, implementing features such as <i>sprinting and a hunger system.</i>
    </p>

    <h3><a href="versions/release.html">Full Release</a></h3>
    <p>
        In 2011, the game officially released, now complete with an ending to the game. This is the beginning of modern Minecraft as we know it today.
    </p>


    <h2>The Betacraft launcher</h2>
    <p>
        The Betacraft auncher allows for a large majority of old Minecraft versions to be played in the state that they were released in. It's basically a requirement for anyone wanting to play old versions since the official Minecraft launcher is missing most of the versions and the ones that are availible are broken or missing sounds.
